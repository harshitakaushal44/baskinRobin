    <p>Palolem Beach is a stretch of white sand on a bay in Goa, South India. It's known for its calm waters and for its nightlife, including "silent discos" where partygoers wear headphones. Lined with palm trees and colorful wooden shacks, the beach faces Canacona Island, known for its resident monkeys. To the south, turtles nest at Galgibaga Beach. Inland, Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is home to birds, wild boars and gaur.</p>
